# ExeGuide
 This is a site for guiding gym rats and amateurs to what exercise to make and how to make it.

   Thanks to SoftUni this site was made. It's still in early development but still proud of it. 
   
   In this site the normal user can see different exercises and how to make them. He can see what equipment is used and what muscle groups are used. The normal user can read Articles as well (or something like that,further to be mastered).
If the User registers in the site, he will have accsess to "Add to favourites" option and "My favourites" page where he can review his favourite exercises so he doesen't forget them.

  Because of SoftUni's criteria there are different roles in this site. There are Editor and Writer role.

  Editor role: 
  The Editor can create,edit and delete exercises. 
He must add exercises that does not exist in the site's databse. He must put the right parameters such as: exercise title, muscle groups,equipment and description (how to do). If the Editor makes an error in his task, he can edit the error he has made or Delete the whole exercise (if needed).
 
  Writer role:
  The Writer can create,edit and delete articles.
He adds articles to the site. They have different categories to be choosen. When wanted or ordered the writer writes the article, reviews it and post it so eveeryone can read them. If he makes a mistake, he can edit the article and post it again. If ordered or needed the writer can delete the chosen article.




 This site is and early project but created with love and hope.
